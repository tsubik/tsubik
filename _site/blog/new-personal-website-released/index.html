Finally I've found some time to refresh my personal website. Nothing changed here for a years and the blog was already dead. Even if I liked old design of my website I decided to change it definitely. It was looking too darkly, too gloomy and had many unnecessary graphics elements which could be swapped by simple text using proper fonts. The next problem was lack of support for mobile devices, the page was not adapting to device screen at all.

<p>
As I am a web developer I've decided not to use any CMS solution to build me site (simply I don't need it). Going further I've decided to my website be a completely static html site.
</p>
<p>
So I've made a list of requirement my site must meet:
</p>
<ol type="1">
	<li>Be static and easily to modify.<br />
To meet this I am using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> tool built in Ruby. This is a static site generation tool, allowing you to use layouts, templates and many nice features. Building site with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> could be a topic for another blog post, I just do not want to describe it here. You can check out a code of this site on <a href="http://github.com/tsubik/tsubik">github</a>. Firstly I was trying playing with some Jekyll .NET Port library called <a href="https://github.com/Code52/pretzel">Pretzel</a>, but after having so many troubles with it, I decided to leave it at this moment.
</li>
	<li>
	Have a responsive design to adopt to mobile devices screens.
	</li>
	<li>
	Be bright, simple and without any unnecessary fireworks.</li>
</ol>
<p>
I think I met these requirements so I hope you will like my new design. Enjoy.
